# React Portfolio

## Description

The purpose of this project is to use react to create a portfolio that showcases my new skills while setting me apart from other developers whose portfolios don't use the latest technologies. This single-page application is deployed to Netlify, affording employers the opportunity to assess my candidacy for open positions.

- My motivation for this application was fueled by the need to distinguish myself from the masses in an ever-growing, talent-saturated industry.
