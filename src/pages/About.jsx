            Without a doubt, coding is where it is at! My name is Raymond Bell.
            I am a proud military veteran and native Texan who enjoys the
            outdoors. <br />
            I reside in the Dallas-Fort Worth Metroplex. My favorite outdoor
            activities include fishing, hunting, golfing, and grilling. <br />
            I could easily concatenate that list with hiking and camping.
            Traveling also has a warm spot in my heart. I have lived in two
            foreign countries<br />
            and visited seven others, so I enjoy diversity and value
            multiculturalism. However, learning is something that I treasure
            more than any of these. <br />
            Recently, I decided to plunge into technology in a way I had never
            done before. I have worked in and with technology throughout my
            20-plus-year career,<br />
            but this is different. Now, I am enjoying the journey of learning
            and applying code snippets to develop applications designed to
            enhance personal,<br />
            and business decision-making.
